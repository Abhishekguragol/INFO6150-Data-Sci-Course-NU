    "### Bayesian vs Frequentist Statistics: *What's the difference?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Any statistical inferece paradigm, Bayesian or otherwise, involves at least the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Some **unknown quantities** about which we are interested in learning or testing. We call these *parameters*. These are called the dependent variables.\n",
    "2. Some **data** which have been observed, and hopefully contains information about the parameters. These are called the independent variables.\n",
    "3. One or more **models** that relate the data to the dependent parameters. The model is the instrument used to learn. For example, you learn about the real world from the model that your parents build for you, before you can leave home to see the real thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a *frequentist* World view, **Data** observed is considered **random**, because it is the realization of random processes and hence will vary each time one goes to observe the system. Model **parameters** are considered **fixed**. A parameter's true value is uknown but fixed. Max Verstappen has a fixed probability of winning each race. Jesus Christ is a fixed parameter in the Christian World Model. Christians will say the world order may be random because of human misgivings, but Jesus Christ and his compassion is fixed and steadfast.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a *Bayesian* World view,  Data is considered **fixed**. Model parameters are **random** and Bayesians use probability distributions to describe their uncertainty. In some cases, it is useful to consider parameters as having been sampled from probability distributions. Max Verstappen's probability of winning each race varies with every race: The more he wins the higher it gets. Christians may postulate that world order is predetermined, but Jesus Christ's compassion may vary because sometimes he gets exasperated by his followers."

    "## Bayes' Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "While frequentist statistics uses different estimators for different problems, Bayes formula is the **only estimator** that Bayesians need to obtain estimates of unknown quantities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation expresses how our belief about the value of \\\\(\\theta\\\\), the parameters in our model, as expressed by the **prior distribution** \\\\(P(\\theta)\\\\), which is reallocated following the observation of the data \\\\(y\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete random variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"font-size: 120%;\">  \n",
    "\\\\[Pr(\\theta\\;|\\;y) = \\frac{Pr(\\theta \\cap y)}{Pr(y)} = \\frac{Pr(y\\;|\\;\\theta)Pr(\\theta)}{\\sum_\\theta Pr(y\\;|\\;\\theta)Pr(\\theta)} \\\\]\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous random variables, the denominator usually cannot be computed directly, and is actually the expression in the numerator integrated over all possible model parameters \\\\(\\theta\\\\):\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"font-size: 120%;\">  \n",
    "\\\\[Pr(\\theta\\;|\\;y) = \\frac{Pr(y\\;|\\;\\theta)Pr(\\theta)}{\\int Pr(y\\;|\\;\\theta)Pr(\\theta) d\\theta}\\\\]\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The intractability of this integral led to the under-utilization of Bayesian methods by statisticians. But with the advent of computers and clever algorithms like Metropolis-Hastings, this has changed.\n"

    "We'll use a fictitious example from [Kruschke (2012)](http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/articles/KruschkeAJ2012.pdf) concerning the evaluation of a clinical trial for drug evaluation. The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of a \"smart drug\" that is supposed to increase intelligence by comparing IQ scores of individuals in a treatment arm (those receiving the drug) to those in a control arm (those recieving a placebo). There are 47 individuals and 42 individuals in the treatment (`drug`) and control (`placebo`) arms, respectively, and these are their post-trial IQs. An IQ between 90 and 110 is considered average; over 120, superior. Let's look at the histograms of our data, first thing you should always do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that although our IQ data is integer type, our datasets here could easily be real-valued, and so we consider our random variable to be continuous.\n",

    "[Statistical hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing), also called [confirmatory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) is a framework for determining whether observed data *deviates* from what is expected. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between two data sets, and this is compared as an alternative to an idealized `null hypothesis` that proposes no relationship between two data sets. Python's `scipy.stats` library contains an array of functions that make it easy to carry out hypothesis tests. "

    "### Statistical Hypothesis Testing in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to test whether the statistics of the placebo group is different from the drug group, the **null hypothesis** would be that ***there is no difference***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a **hypothesis test** is to determine whether the null hypothesis is likely to be true given sample data. If there is little evidence against the null hypothesis given the data, you accept the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is unlikely given the data, you might reject the null in favor of the alternative hypothesis: that something interesting/strange is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the null and alternative hypothesis in hand, you choose a **significance level** (often denoted by the Greek letter $\\alpha$). The significance level is a probability threshold that determines when you ***reject*** the null hypothesis. After carrying out a test, if the probability of getting a result as strange as the one you observe is lower than the significance level, you reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. If the probability is higher than $\\alpha$, then the null hypothesis is in effect and the result is not strange at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "This probability of seeing a result as strange or more strange than the one observed is known as the `p-value`. If the `p-value`is high, uncertainty in the experiment is high, and it will be difficult to conclude one way or the other. If the `p-value` is low, there is low probability to see a strange result, and so if we see a strange result, it is conclusive that the drug and placebo groups follow different distributions and thus that the drug group has an effect. The `T-test` is a statistical test, based on the `p-value`, used to determine whether a numeric sampling differs significantly from the population, or whether two samples differ from one another. That, in a nutshell, is traditional statistics for data science! "

    "A *confidence interval* is a range of sample values above and below a point estimate of a parameter (like the `mean`) that captures the true population parameter at some predetermined confidence level. For example, if you want to have a 95% chance of capturing the *true* population mean, you'd set your confidence level to 95%. Confidence levels are related to the size of your sampling, and the standard deviation of the *true* population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we also say the *confidence level* is 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *significance level* (denoted by $\\alpha$) is 1 - the confidence interval bound. So, a significance level of 0.05 corresponds to a confidence level of 95%. \n",
    "\n",
    "You calculate a confidence interval by taking a point estimate of some parameter (e.g. the mean) from a sample with size $n$ and then adding and subtracting a *margin of error* to create a range. Margin of error is based on your desired confidence level, the spread of the population, and the size of your sample. The way you calculate the margin of error depends on whether you know the spread of the population or not. If you know the standard deviation $\\sigma$ of the population (a measure of spread), the margin of error is equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z ∗ \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $z$ is a number known as the `z-critical value`. The `z-critical value` is the *number* of standard deviations you'd have to go from the mean of the distribution to capture the proportion of the data associated with the desired confidence level. For instance, we know that roughly 95% of the data in a *normal* (gaussian) distribution lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean, so we use 2 as the `z-critical value` for a 95% confidence interval. For all other distributions, you use the quantile function `stats.t.ppf` to compute $z$.\n"
